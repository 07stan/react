The React add-ons are a collection of useful utility modules for building React apps. **These should be considered experimental** and tend to change more often than the core.

- [`PureRenderMixin`](pure-render-mixin.html), a performance booster under certain situations. Superseded by [`React.PureComponent`](/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent).

The add-ons below are in the development (unminified) version of React only:

- [`ReactTestUtils`](test-utils.html), simple helpers for writing test cases.

To get the add-ons, install them individually from npm (e.g., `npm install react-addons-test-utils`). We don't support using the addons if you're not using npm.
